  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 2025</p>

  <p>This mobile application (“the app”) allows users to search for movies, view details and trailers, and organize their selections into lists using a genre-based wheel interface. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The app uses third-party services provided by Google Firebase, which may automatically collect limited information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> – to understand how users interact with the app (e.g., which screens are visited, searches performed, genre filters used).</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> – to detect and fix app crashes or bugs.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The types of data that may be collected include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and operating system</li>
    <li>App usage data (screen visits, button clicks, search behavior)</li>
    <li>Anonymous identifiers (e.g., advertising ID)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>No personally identifiable information (such as your name, email, phone number, or address) is collected by the app.</strong></p>

  <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>The data collected is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To improve the app’s performance and stability</li>
    <li>To better understand user behavior and enhance the user experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>No personal data is shared with third parties, other than through the services mentioned above (Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics).</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Data is securely stored by Firebase. For more details, please refer to Firebase's privacy policy:
  <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any significant changes will be reflected on this page.</p>
